	<h2>The Sun, The Earth and Climate Change</h2>
	<h3>Climate Change Background</h3>
		<p>You almost certainly have heard of climate change if you follow the news.  Climate change (sometimes called "global warming") is a global phenomenon where the all the temperatures of all the places on Earth taken together increase.  Some places may warm, some may cool, but the average of all temperatures increase.  The following table shows how high the temperature has risen over the last several years:</p>


	<h3>The Sun and The Earth</h3>
		<p>The Earth does not warm on its own for no reason.  The Sun radiates energy down on the Earth.</p>
		<section>This energy:
		 	<ul>
		 		<li>Is the light we see from the Sun.</li>
		 		<li>Is the warmth we feel from the Sun.</li>
		 		<li>Drives winds and ocean currents.</li>
		 		<li>Causes plants to grow.</li>
		 	</ul>
		 </section>
		<p>The Earth also radiates.  It throws off radiation into empty space energy in all directions.  This causes the Earth to lose energy.</p>
		<p>When the amount of energy from the Sun is balanced with the amount of energy radiating away from the Earth, the temperature stays steady overall.  There are many things that go into this balance.  On the next page, we will discuss one of these elements: the atmosphere.</p>
