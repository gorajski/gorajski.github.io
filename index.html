	<h2>The Sun, The Earth and Climate Change</h2>
	<h3>Climate Change Background</h3>
		<p>You almost certainly have heard of climate change if you follow the news.  Climate change (<i>sometimes called "global warming"</i>) is a global phenomenon where the all the temperatures of all the places on Earth taken together increase.  Some places may warm, some may cool, but the average of all temperatures increase.  The following table shows that the temperature has been above average over the last several years and the increase tends to get bigger:</p>

	<h3>The Sun and The Earth</h3>
		<p>The Earth does not warm on its own for no reason.  The Sun <b>radiates</b> energy down on the Earth.</p>
		<img src="Sun_radiates.png" alt="Sun shines down on Earth.">
		<section>This energy:
		 	<ul>
		 		<li>Is the light we see from the Sun.</li>
		 		<li>Is the warmth we feel from the Sun.</li>
		 		<li>Drives winds and ocean currents.</li>
		 		<li>Causes plants to grow.</li>
		 	</ul>
		 </section>
		<p>The Earth also radiates.  It throws off radiation into empty space energy in all directions.  This causes the Earth to lose energy.</p>
		<img src="Earth_radiates.png" alt="The Earth radiates energy to space.">
		<p>When the amount of energy from the Sun is <b>balanced</b> with the amount of energy radiating away from the Earth, the temperature stays steady overall.</p>
		<img src="Earth_balance.png" alt="The radiation in and radiation out are in balance.">
		<p>There are many things that go into this balance.  On the next page, we will discuss one of these elements: the atmosphere.</p>
